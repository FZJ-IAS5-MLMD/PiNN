=========================================
PiNN: Pairwise interaction Neural Network
=========================================
PiNN is a atomic neural network potential algorithm. This package is currently
being developed primarily by Yunqi Shao. The PiNN package is designed to work
with ASE and tensorflow.

Introduction
============
The PiNN code is a machine learning package for atomic systems.
For more discussion, please visit our documentation.

The goal of PiNN is to develope a common abstraction for different atomic neural
networks(ANNs), and allow for the efficient construction of ANNs.


Installation
============
PiNN is currently under development and available via git repo::

  git clone https://github.com/yqshao/pinn.git
  cd pinn && pip install -e .
