PiNN
====

The vanilla PiNN is yet another graph convolution ANN.
The primary multivation of PiNN is to design the struture
such that the interactions are more compliant to chemical intuition.
The goal for such disign is so that the interactions can be percieved directly.
In PiNN, the interaction is modeled as
**a distance dependent function, whose form depends on the properties of both members in a pair**.
